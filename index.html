		Hacker since eight. Built network on a network (think IaaS), language processing, and license plate recognition software in college. I love doing intelligent things with data.

		I've worked on a number of projects. Many know me as the creator of <a href="http://headline.adammenges.com">headline</a>. Others may know me, or rather my face, from a picture in a Hong Kong airport bookstore (I only found out about this recently).

		I love chatting with new people. It's definitely one of life's great pleasures. If you'd like to get in touch, shoot me an email, <a href="mailto:adam@adammenges.com">adam@adammenges.com</a>, or send me a text, <a href="sms:720-484-0275">720-484-0275</a>.
